The algorithm is a simple implementation of a binary search, which is a search strategy that is used to find a specific element in a sorted array. The basic idea behind binary search is to divide the search space in half at each step, and only explore the half that is likely to contain the goal state.

The algorithm begins by defining the goal state and the search space. In this example, the goal state is the number 12, and the search space is an array of integers.

Next, the search function is called to perform the search. This function takes the search space, and the start and end indices of the section of the array that should be searched at each step.

The search function first checks if the start and end indices have crossed, which indicates that the goal state was not found. If they have, the function returns -1 to indicate that the search failed.

If the start and end indices have not crossed, the function calculates the middle index of the search space and checks if the element at that index is the goal state. If it is, the function returns the index of the goal state.

If the middle element is not the goal state, the function checks if it is less than or greater than the goal state. If it is less than the goal state, the function searches the right half of the array by calling itself with the updated start and end indices. If it is greater than the goal state, the function searches the left half of the array by calling itself with the updated start and end indices.

This process continues until the goal state is found or the search fails.

Here is an example of how the algorithm would work for the search space [4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12] and the goal state 12:

The search function is called with the start index 0 and the end index 11, which corresponds to the entire search space.
The middle index is calculated as (0 + 11) / 2 = 5, and the element at index 5 is checked. Since 1 is not equal to 12, the search continues.
Since 1 is less than 12, the search function is called again with the start index 6 and the end index 11, which corresponds to the right half of the array.
The middle index is calculated as (6 + 11) / 2 = 8, and the element at index 8 is checked. Since 8 is not equal to 12, the search continues.
Since 8 is less than 12, the search function is called again with the start index 9 and the end index 11, which corresponds to the right half of the array.
The middle index is calculated as (9 + 11) / 2 = 10, and the element at index 10 is checked. Since 11 is not equal to 12, the search continues.
Since 11 is less than 12, the search function is called again with the start index 11 and the end index 11, which corresponds to the right half of the array.
The middle index is calculated as (11 + 11) / 2 = 11, and the element at index 11 is checked. Since 12 is equal to 12, the search is successful and the index 11 is returned.
